# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
You can deploy now or [later](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart?authuser=0). To deploy now, open a terminal window, then navigate to or create a root directory for your web app.

## Sign in to Google

```firebase login```

## Initiate your project
Run this command from your app's root directory:

```firebase init```

## When you're ready, deploy your web app
Put your static files (e.g. HTML, CSS, JS) in your app’s deploy directory (the default is 'public'). Then, run this command from your app’s root directory:

```firebase deploy````

After deploying, view your app at [smoothies-recipes-vuejs-demo.web.app](https://smoothies-recipes-vuejs-demo.web.app/)
